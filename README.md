### Why Hello!!! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Midnight!  I'm learning Full Stack Development at dev Code Camp (August 2021 to Nov 2021).  I love knowing how things work so I wanted to learn both the front and back end to development.  I especially enjoy the front end, though, because I enjoy making things look nice! 


<p>
These are the languages that I've been learning through the dCC:

I'm hoping now that I'm done with dCC that I can find a great job in the field but also let me work on the few side-projects that I would like to tackle.  I originally got started in this because a friend did and suggested I try too and I quickly found out that I love writing code.  I love knowing how to make things work and the satisfaction of getting something particularly finicky or difficult to work is a feeling that can't be beat!  Aside from the study of dCC, I spend a lot of time watching and reading tutorials in the langauges that we've been learning to better my understanding in each of them.
